/*
 * This code is for the bachelor thesis named "Towed-ROV".
 * The purpose is to build a ROV which will be towed behind a surface vessel
 * and act as a multi-sensor platform, were it shall be easy to place new 
 * sensors. There will also be a video stream from the ROV.
 * 
 * The system consists of two Raspberry Pis in the ROV that is connected to
 * several Arduino micro controllers. These micro controllers are connected to
 * feedback from the actuators, the echo sounder and extra optional sensors.
 * The external computer which is on the surface vessel is connected to a GPS,
 * echo sounder over USB, and the ROV over ethernet. It will present and
 * log data in addition to handle user commands for controlling the ROV.
